# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

This program allows a user to input an employee's first and last name, along with their annual salary and compiles that information into a chart. It also finds the average salary of all the employees entered and selects a random employee from the list. 
	
## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Visit the employee payroll tracker here: bethanyproctor.github.io/employee-payroll-tracker-js/ 

After clicking the "Add New Employee" button, enter the employee's first name, last name, and their salary. This puts their information on the page in a chart. To see the average salary, open the console. The console also shows the randomly selected employee, who has been selected to win a fake drawing.

The MDN page on finding a random number was very helpful for this project, especially when wanting to include the minimum and maximum numbers. Find that page here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
